"""Direct unit tests for judges.py — no harness bootstrap required.

Complements test_judges.py, which exercises the same logic through the
pinned harness's real EvalConfig/load_judges path (and skips gracefully if
the harness isn't cloned locally). This file calls rubric_scoring()/
critical_findings_recall() directly, so these two judges have a coverage
floor even before evals/review/setup-harness.sh has ever been run.
