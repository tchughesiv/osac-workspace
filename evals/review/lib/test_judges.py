"""Synthetic-output tests for the eval-*.yaml module/function judges.

Loads eval-prd-review.yaml and eval-design-review.yaml through the pinned
agent-eval-harness's own EvalConfig/load_judges, then feeds each judge
synthetic `outputs` dicts directly (no case files on disk, no LLM calls) —
this exercises the actual judge-loading and code-judge-execution path the
harness uses at eval time (importlib.import_module against
evals/review/lib/judges.py), confirming both eval YAMLs are wired to the
real functions correctly. See test_judges_lib.py for direct,
harness-independent tests of judges.py itself.

Skips gracefully if the pinned harness hasn't been bootstrapped locally
(run evals/review/setup-harness.sh first).
