# OSAC workspace evals

Workspace-native evaluation tooling for measuring agentic SDLC quality. Lives in
`osac-workspace` alongside `skills/` and `.design/context/` — not a bootstrapped
component repo and not a separate clone.

## Location decision

| Approach | This project |
|----------|--------------|
| Separate `osac-review-eval` repo | **No** |
| Bootstrapped component (like `fulfillment-service`) | **No** |
| Workspace-native `evals/` tree | **Yes** |

Bugfix evals remain in external [`eranco74/osac-bugfix-eval`](https://github.com/eranco74/osac-bugfix-eval).
Clone separately; set `BUGFIX_EVAL_REPO`. Phase 2 links review and bugfix results
via `evals/run-all.sh`.

## Prerequisites

Run all eval commands from the **workspace root** (the directory that contains
`enhancement-proposals/` and `skills/`).

1. **Bootstrap the workspace**

   ```bash
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```

   This clones `enhancement-proposals/` and links agent skills (including
   `prd-review` and `design-review`) under `.claude/skills/`.

2. **Claude Code CLI** — required for headless skill execution.

3. **agent-eval-harness** — pinned checkout bootstrapped locally:

   ```bash
   evals/review/setup-harness.sh
   ```

   This reads `evals/review/harness.lock`, clones to
   `evals/review/.harness/agent-eval-harness`, checks out the pinned ref, and
   creates `.eval-venv` with an editable install.

   Pin **≥ v1.13.0** (lifecycle `hooks` in eval YAML). This repo locks **v1.22.0**
   in `harness.lock` (recommended).

   Harness is **not** installed by `./bootstrap.sh` — run `setup-harness.sh` when
   you need review evals.

   `run-eval.sh` uses that checkout by default. Override with
   `AGENT_EVAL_HARNESS=/other/path` for harness development.

   Optional Claude Code plugin (for `/eval-run` skill workflows):

   ```bash
   claude plugin install agent-eval-harness@opendatahub-skills
   ```

   To bump the harness version: edit `harness.lock`, run `setup-harness.sh`,
   re-run the dry-run smoke below, then commit the lock file.

   **Execution path:** `run-eval.sh` calls the harness **script chain**
   (`preflight.py` → `workspace.py` → `execute.py` → `collect.py` → `score.py`).
   Do not depend on the upstream `agent-eval run` CLI until
   [PR #109](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/agent-eval-harness/pull/109) merges.

## Per-case workspaces and `workspace.py --symlinks`

Review evals use harness **case mode**: each case gets an isolated workspace.
Case `input.yaml` paths such as `enhancement-proposals/enhancements/.../prd.md` are
relative to the **osac-workspace root**, but the skill runs inside the per-case
workspace. `run-eval.sh` passes `--symlinks` to `workspace.py` so those paths resolve.

Minimum symlinks required (always include these):

- `enhancement-proposals` — document targets under `enhancement-proposals/`
- `.design` — review skills load `.design/context/`

`run-eval.sh` also symlinks `skills`, `.claude`, and `CLAUDE.md` so headless
`prd-review` / `design-review` skills match `./bootstrap.sh` layout.

Skill-based review evals use `runner.type: claude-code` with per-case workspaces.
Do **not** use `runner.workspace_mode: repo` (in-repo execution is for prompt-mode
evals only in harness v1.22.0).

Prerequisite checks run in two places:

1. **`run-eval.sh`** (before harness) — workspace root, skills, harness checkout
2. **`hooks.before_all` in eval YAML** — re-validates inside each case workspace
   during `execute.py` (skipped when using `--skip-execute`)

## Gitignored paths and baseline

`evals/review/.gitignore` excludes:

- `.harness/` — pinned harness clone
- `results/` — harness run output
- `artifacts/` — per-case skill output during runs

Committed baseline summaries (golden-set scores, rubric pins) are not part of
this initial scaffold — they land once golden cases and a baseline run exist.

## Models

Planning review evals pin Claude models in each eval YAML (`models.skill`, `models.judge`).
Bugfix eval model policy remains in external `osac-bugfix-eval`.

| Role | Pinned model | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Skill (`prd-review`, `design-review`) | `claude-opus-4-6` | Matches team default for review evals |
| Judge (`models.judge`, LLM judges) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Same model for every LLM judge role — no per-judge override; inline/code `check` judges are model-agnostic |

**Rationale:** align planning review evals with production review quality expectations.
Harness template defaults may differ; this repo pins the fully-qualified slugs used by
`agent-eval-harness`'s own `eval.yaml` template and test suite (the short-form `opus-4.6`
previously pinned here was a non-canonical slug). Skill and judge intentionally use
different models — see the local design decision record for the full rationale
(self-preference vs. family-bias distinction, calibration via Cohen's κ as the primary
trust mechanism, and why a per-judge override was tried and then dropped in favor of one
config line).

Eval YAML pins `claude-opus-4-6` for the skill role and `claude-sonnet-4-6` for the
judge role. The baseline report records pinned models alongside `rubric_version`.

**Bump policy:** intentional model changes require YAML update and a new baseline run.
Ad-hoc override: harness `/eval-run --model` or edit eval YAML locally (not committed).

## Production EP review vs planning eval harness

Two related paths measure review skills; they are **not** the same invocation today.

| Path | When | How skills run | Role in the agentic-SDLC metrics program |
|------|------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Production EP review** | Live `enhancement-proposals` PRs | **agentic-ci** (`run_skill` — see EP review automation, tracked in **OSAC-1773**) | Operational gate + Org Pulse visibility |
| **Planning eval harness** | Local / manual CI smoke | **agent-eval-harness** script chain + `runner.type: claude-code` (`run-eval.sh`) | Phase 1 regression on **human-validated** golden cases |

(The "agentic-SDLC metrics program" is Feature **OSAC-959** — create metrics and
methods to evaluate the success of the agentic-SDLC process over time.)

**Phase 1 program decision:** the eval harness is the source of truth for **golden-set regression** and baseline (**OSAC-2267**). EP bot pass/fail is **not** the Phase 1 eval gate (see `measurement-taxonomy.md` E2E phasing).

**Convergence:** document parity gaps explicitly; a future spike may align skill entrypoints if agentic-ci and harness expose the same skill IDs and artifact paths (`artifacts/review-output.md`). Until then, do not assume production CI and `run-eval.sh` share one code path.

## CI smoke (manual)

GitHub Actions workflow **[`.github/workflows/evals-review-smoke.yml`](../.github/workflows/evals-review-smoke.yml)** runs on **`workflow_dispatch` only** (no per-PR LLM cost):

1. `./bootstrap.sh --no-fork`
2. `evals/review/setup-harness.sh`
3. `run-eval.sh` for prd + design `_harness-smoke` with `--skip-execute --skip-score`

Full scored evals remain **local** or a separate manual workflow until secrets and cost policy are agreed (**OSAC-2266**).

## What we do not do

Review evals intentionally avoid patterns from `osac-bugfix-eval` that duplicate
workspace setup:

- No `deps/osac-workspace` clone
- No `workspace-template/` or per-case symlink farms
- No `setup.sh` that re-clones `enhancement-proposals` (already provided by `./bootstrap.sh`)

The harness runs with workspace root as CWD and symlinks `skills/`, `.claude/`,
`.design/`, and `enhancement-proposals/` into each case workspace.

## Review evals (`evals/review/`)

Planning-phase evals measure `prd-review` and `design-review` skill quality against
human-validated reference cases.

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `evals/review/harness.lock` | Pinned agent-eval-harness ref and SHA |
| `evals/review/setup-harness.sh` | Bootstrap harness into `.harness/` |
| `evals/review/eval-prd-review.yaml` | Harness config for PRD review |
| `evals/review/eval-design-review.yaml` | Harness config for design review |
| `evals/review/run-eval.sh` | CLI runner wired to agent-eval-harness |
| `evals/review/cases/` | Test cases (`prd/`, `design/`) |
| `evals/review/docs/` | Measurement taxonomy and case schema |
| `evals/review/results/` | Run output (gitignored) |
| `evals/review/lib/` | `validate_cases.py`, `judges.py` (shared `rubric_scoring`/`critical_findings_recall` logic used by both eval configs via `module`/`function` judges), and their pytest suites |

Run the `evals/review/lib/` pytest suites locally (no LLM calls):

```bash
pip install -r evals/review/lib/requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest evals/review/lib/ -v
```

See [`evals/review/README.md`](review/README.md) and
[`evals/review/docs/`](review/docs/) for case layout and metrics.

## Dry-run smoke (no LLM)

Validates harness wiring, eval YAML, and workspace layout without skill execution
or scoring:

```bash
evals/review/setup-harness.sh
evals/review/run-eval.sh --type prd --case _harness-smoke --skip-execute --skip-score
evals/review/run-eval.sh --type design --case _harness-smoke --skip-execute --skip-score
```

Same steps run in CI via **Actions → Evals review smoke** (`workflow_dispatch`) —
see [CI smoke (manual)](#ci-smoke-manual) above for the workflow itself.

Judges and `validate_cases.py` are configured in eval YAML and `evals/review/lib/`.
Golden cases live under `evals/review/cases/`; a committed baseline lands under
`evals/review/results/baseline/` once curated.
